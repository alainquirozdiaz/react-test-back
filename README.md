## Welcome to the React Test Project!

This project consists of a frontend and a backend component. To get started, follow the instructions below to clone both repositories and run them simultaneously.

## Cloning Repositories
Both repositories need to be cloned to your local machine. You can clone them using the following links:

Frontend: [https://github.com/alainquirozdiaz/react-test]
Backend: [https://github.com/alainquirozdiaz/react-test-back]

## Frontend

Clone the frontend repository:
### `git clone https://github.com/alainquirozdiaz/react-test`

Navigate to the cloned directory:
### `cd react-test`

Install dependencies and start the frontend server:
### `npm install`

### `npm start`

### Access the application in your browser at: `http://localhost:3000`

## Backend

Clone the backend repository:
### `git clone https://github.com/alainquirozdiaz/react-test-back`

That's it! You should now have both the frontend and backend servers running simultaneously. Enjoy exploring the React Test Project! If you have any questions or issues, feel free to reach me out.

# NOTES

* This application includes functionality to limit certain features when there is no internet access.
* The displayed blog records in the frontend are retrieved from the blogs.json file located at react-test\src\assets\blogs.json.
* The backend saves and updates records within a file named blogs.json located at \react-test-back\assets\blogs.json using Node.js's filesystem.
